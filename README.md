# Introduction
Having a homelab is important, and there are many ways to set one up for what's needed to be done. Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration utlity and it's a skill I would like to have. Approachng this, there are multiple ways to create a cluster so that Kubernetes can operate. There's always the cloud which will utilize AWS or Azure which is great, but I wanted hands on equipment. Raspberry Pis were great for this. After setting up Kubectl and relized that I achieved the cluster, it was a matter of learning more about what I can do with it. I learned alot and most importantly, I have a homelan where I can work on future projects.

# Kubernetes-Raspberry-Pi4-Cluster-Home-Lab

# The introduction
Having a homelab will further my knowledge in networking and especially Kubernetes. It is great how you can have a home network and experiment without an enterprise system! What is even better is that you can use Raspberry Pis and they are affordable. This repo is going to document the journey while also explaining what I have learned. Let the fun begin. 

# What I want to accomplish with this homelab
- How to set up a network
- Use Linux to navigate and setup Kubernetes 
- Learn key concepts of Kubernetes 
- Make sure my network is secure
- The pro and cons of a cluster server
- How I can improve my homelab and move on to a bigger system.

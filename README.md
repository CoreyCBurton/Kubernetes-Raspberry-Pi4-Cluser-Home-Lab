# Kubernetes-Raspberry-Pi4-Cluster-Home-Lab

# The introduction
Having a homelab will further my knowledge in networking and especially Kubernetes. It is great how you can have a network and experiment without an enterprise system! What is even better is that you can use Raspberry pis and they are afforbale. This repo is going to document the journey and it will always be great to look back after I move to a bigger homelab. Let the fun begin.

# What I want to accomplish with this homelab
- How to set up a network
- Use Linux to navigate and setup Kubernetes 
- Learn key concepts of Kubernetes 
- Make sure my network is secure
- The pro and cons of a cluster server

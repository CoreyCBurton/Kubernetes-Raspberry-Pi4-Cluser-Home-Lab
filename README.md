# Kubernetes-Raspberry-Pi4-Cluster-Home-Lab

**The introduction**
Having a homelab will further my knowledge in networking and especially Kubernetes. It is great how you can make a network and experiment without an enterprise system! What is even better is that you can use Raspberry pis and they are afforbale so anyone can do it. This repo is going to document the journey and it will always be great to look back after I move to a bigger homelab. Let the fun begin.

# Introduction
Having Prometheus and Grafana on your Raspberry Pi is a great way to monitor the usage on your cluster. Using Helm charts that are provided with Kubernetes, we can achieve this. My local machine is going to be using MacOS which has the Kubectl. 

# Cluster-monitoring
Following this [repo](https://github.com/carlosedp/cluster-monitoring), We can have an optimized Grafana-dashboard for our raspberry pi cluster. The first step is to clone the repo using the command below
```
git clone https://github.com/carlosedp/cluster-monitoring.git
```
Cd into the directory CLuster monitoring 

# Editing vars.jsonnet
Using command ``sudo nano vars.jsonnet`` we can edit the config to match our Raspberry Pi settings.

Under the k3s config, you want to add your master ip. It should look like this below 
```
k3s:{
  enabled: true,
  master_ip: [<MasterNode>]
}
```
Below that, The domain suffix needs to be editied to one of your worker nodes.
```
suffixDomain: `192.168.1.132.nip.io` 
```

# Installing make on MacOS
* Using the command `` brew install make`` we can download the make tool which will allow us to finish installing Grafana. 

# Installing Golang on MacOS
Following this [guide](https://golang.org/doc/install). Download the package file and verify using the command below.
```
$ go version
```
# Installing command line tools 
```
xcode-select --install
```

# Installing Grafana
```
$ make vendor
$ make
$ make deploy

# Or manually:

$ make vendor
$ make
$ kubectl apply -f manifests/setup/
$ kubectl apply -f manifests/
```
# The process of installing Grafana using make
Using the command `` kubectl apply -f manifests/setup/ ``, it creates a namespace called monitoring which is deploying Grafana to the pods. 

Using the command ``kubectl get pods -n monitoring `` you can see the output below that everything is deployed
```

# Open Grafana 
using the command below allows you to see the host name 
```
kubectl get ingress -n monitoring

# Introduction
By default, Ubuntu server LTS has DCHP enabled. This guide will have steps to set a static ip which is necessary to keep the kubectl synchronized with the IP addresses that where setup at the start. 

# Netplan configuration
- Go to the directory /etc/netplan.
  - There should be some files listed. If there is a file such as ``50-cloud`` you can ignore this. 
  - Make a new file using called ``01-network-manager.yaml``. Please note: The file has to start with a set of numbers and end with .yaml
  - Use vim or nano to edit. It has to be in sudo privlege. 
# ip -a 
- It is important to see what adapter you are using through ip -a. This will vary from person to person. In my siutation, I am connected via eth0. 
  - en3sop is also common. In the .yaml file, replace it with the adapter listed.

# Modifying .yaml file
- Add the following lines below in ``01-network-manger.yaml`` in the ``/etc/netplan directory``.
```
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    eth0:
     dhcp4: false
     addresses: [<ip address?]
     gateway4: <ip address>
     nameservers:
       addresses: [8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4]
```
# Apply configuration
- To try this configuration, use command ``sudo netplan try``
  - If it goes through smoothly, its going to ask if you would like to keep this configuration. 
  - If there are errors, it could be possible that you didn't set the address and gateway 4 address right. 

- To apply settings, use command ``sudo netplan apply``
  - Use ``ip -a`` to see if the IP has changed
